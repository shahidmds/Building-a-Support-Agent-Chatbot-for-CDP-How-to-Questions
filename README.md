# Building a Support Agent Chatbot for CDP

# üìå Objective

Develop a chatbot that can answer "how-to" questions related to four Customer Data Platforms (CDPs): Segment, mParticle, Lytics, and Zeotap. The chatbot extracts relevant information from their official documentation to guide users.

# üîó Data Sources

Segment Documentation - https://segment.com/docs/?ref=nav

mParticle Documentation - https://docs.mparticle.com/

Lytics Documentation - https://docs.lytics.com/

Zeotap Documentation - https://docs.zeotap.com/home/en-us/

# ‚ö° Features

Natural Language Processing (NLP): Understands and processes user queries.

Documentation Retrieval: Fetches relevant information from CDP documentation.

Vector Search: Uses FAISS for semantic search.

AI-Powered Responses: Utilizes Google Gemini API.

Handles Question Variations: Supports different phrasings and prevents irrelevant queries.

Cross-CDP Comparisons: Answers questions about differences between CDPs.

Advanced "How-to" Queries: Provides guidance on complex configurations and integrations.

# üõ† Tech Stack

Backend: FastAPI, Python

AI & NLP: Google Gemini-2.0 API, FAISS, Sentence Transformers

Data Storage: JSON (for document storage), FAISS index for embeddings

Web Scraping (Optional): BeautifulSoup/Selenium

Deployment: AWS/GCP, Uvicorn

# 3Ô∏è‚É£ Retriever - Sentence Transformers

Uses all-MiniLM-L6-v2 to convert text into vector embeddings.

Ensures that user queries and documentation are represented in the same vector space.

Facilitates efficient retrieval of relevant sections from CDP documentation.

# 4Ô∏è‚É£ Scraping - BeautifulSoup (bs4)

Extracts data from official CDP documentation.

Can automate content updates by periodically fetching new information.

# 5Ô∏è‚É£ LLM Model - Gemini-2.0-Flash

Google‚Äôs lightweight large language model (LLM) optimized for fast response generation.

Provides AI-powered responses to user queries.

Processes text input and generates intelligent answers based on retrieved documentation.

# 6Ô∏è‚É£ Retrieval Method - RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

Enhances the chatbot by combining retrieval-based and generative approaches.

Runs the FastAPI application with high-performance asynchronous capabilities.

Supports production-level deployment.

# 9Ô∏è‚É£ JSON Storage & FAISS Index (Data Handling)

Stores preprocessed document text in JSON format.

Embeddings are saved in FAISS to enable rapid lookup.

# üìä Evaluation Criteria

Accuracy in responses.

Code quality and best practices.

Handling variations in question phrasing.

Bonus Features: Cross-CDP comparisons, advanced queries.
