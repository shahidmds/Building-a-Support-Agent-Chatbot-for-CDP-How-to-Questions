# Building a Support Agent Chatbot for CDP

# üìå Objective

Develop a chatbot that can answer "how-to" questions related to four Customer Data Platforms (CDPs): Segment, mParticle, Lytics, and Zeotap. The chatbot extracts relevant information from their official documentation to guide users.

# üîó Data Sources

Segment Documentation - https://segment.com/docs/?ref=nav

mParticle Documentation - https://docs.mparticle.com/

Lytics Documentation - https://docs.lytics.com/

Zeotap Documentation - https://docs.zeotap.com/home/en-us/

# ‚ö° Features

Natural Language Processing (NLP): Understands and processes user queries.

Documentation Retrieval: Fetches relevant information from CDP documentation.

Vector Search: Uses FAISS for semantic search.

AI-Powered Responses: Utilizes Google Gemini API.

Handles Question Variations: Supports different phrasings and prevents irrelevant queries.

Cross-CDP Comparisons: Answers questions about differences between CDPs.

Advanced "How-to" Queries: Provides guidance on complex configurations and integrations.

# üõ† Tech Stack

Backend: FastAPI, Python

AI & NLP: Google Gemini-2.0 API, FAISS, Sentence Transformers

Data Storage: JSON (for document storage), FAISS index for embeddings

Web Scraping (Optional): BeautifulSoup/Selenium

Deployment: AWS/GCP, Uvicorn
Building a Support Agent Chatbot for CDP

# üõ† Technologies Used

# 1Ô∏è‚É£ FastAPI (Backend Framework)

A modern, high-performance web framework for building APIs with Python.

Asynchronous support for handling multiple requests efficiently.

Used to expose chatbot functionalities as API endpoints.

# 2Ô∏è‚É£ Google Gemini API (AI/NLP Processing)

Provides AI-powered responses to user queries.

Processes text input and generates intelligent answers based on retrieved documentation.

# 3Ô∏è‚É£ FAISS (Vector Search for Information Retrieval)

Developed by Facebook AI Research for fast similarity searches.

Stores and retrieves embeddings for efficient document matching.

Helps the chatbot find the most relevant sections from CDP documentation.

# 4Ô∏è‚É£ Sentence Transformers (Embeddings Model)

Uses all-MiniLM-L6-v2 to convert text into vector embeddings.

Ensures that user queries and documentation are represented in the same vector space.

# 5Ô∏è‚É£ BeautifulSoup/Selenium (Optional Web Scraping)

Extracts data from official CDP documentation.

Can automate content updates by periodically fetching new information.

# 6Ô∏è‚É£ Uvicorn (ASGI Server)

Runs the FastAPI application with high-performance asynchronous capabilities.

Supports production-level deployment.

# 7Ô∏è‚É£ JSON Storage & FAISS Index (Data Handling)

Stores preprocessed document text in JSON format.

Embeddings are saved in FAISS to enable rapid lookup.

# üìä Evaluation Criteria

Accuracy in responses.

Code quality and best practices.

Handling variations in question phrasing.

Bonus Features: Cross-CDP comparisons, advanced queries.
